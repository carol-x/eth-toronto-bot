# AttestMe Bot 

Welcome to the AttestMe bot! Have you ever find it difficult to connect and refer acquaintances on social media? Have you gotten annoyed by the fake accounts and scams? Here is our solution: we crafted an on-chain attestatiion system for social media! 

AttestMe bot is currently launched on Telegram, which is fabulous in connecting people yet tough to verify accounts and connections. The bot's features break down as follows: 

1. You can connect your on-chain account to the bot by creating a new wallet on Base. We choose Base for its high stability and throughput. 
2. You can attest another friends' telegram account and chip in a referral for them to connect to your friends. Your friends can then use your attestation to prove their authenticity and efficiently connect! 
3. You can choose from a selection of additional attestation schemas to attest someone's skills, fan status, goals, etc. to help build a network map among your acquaintances. 
4. You can check attestations of a new connection to confirm credibility and avoid spam and fraud.
